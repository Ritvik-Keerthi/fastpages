# Some Tools Required for CSA: 2022

## Personal Computer
- This should be pretty self-explanatory. Mr. Mort requires a laptop because you can download all tools without having to deal with any of those annoying school restrictions.

## Anaconda
- Anaconda is a program that will simplify package management and deployment (especially when you install conda and jupyter and all those kernels)
